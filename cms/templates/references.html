           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
           Juhani has given a great practical contribution to the MBA4PhD programme by providing the students with real-life cases and problems to solve, introducing the actual processes in the life-science business and acting as a role model of an entrepreneur.
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students really enjoy Juhani’s practical approach and they appreciate his manifold expertise within the field of life-science. By linking Juhani’s concrete life-science courses with the programme’s theoretical approach of entrepreneurship and new venture creation process has added value to the MBA students.

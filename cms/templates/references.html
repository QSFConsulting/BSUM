Overall the students really enjoyed the session and we would definitely invite Juhani to come back to speak the next time.

            <blockquote>Jari and Juhani were the trainers in our “Feasibility Study for Roal Oy” course, where doctoral students in life sciences worked on an assignment commissioned by Roal Oy. The expertise and professionalism of the trainers were crucial for the success of the course and much appreciated by the students. Jari and Juhani were also commented on their commitment to the project, readiness to help and friendly attitude, making them easy to approach by the students. I am thus happy to recommend BSUM and look forward to working with them in future.
